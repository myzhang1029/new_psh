Command definition:
a command: the minimal unit of execution, can have its own redirections, and can
be of type SIMPLE, RUN_OR, RUN_AND, or PIPED. a job or a queue: one or more
commands connected by ||, &&, or |, a job is terminated with a semicolon to
indicate foreground, or with an ampersand to indicate background execution. a
job is the smallest scheduling unit, and are assigned job ids. `if`, `case`,
`for`, `while`, and `until` are all commands, but are parsed with special care.
